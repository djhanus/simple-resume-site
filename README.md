### Ryan's Feedback


1. I might make "creative developer" text smaller and move "resume" button and social links below the intro paragraph and make that first "slide" have a different color background(?).

2 Core skillset: I'd remove the grey boxes and rethink the icons. Is there a better way to illustrate or portray these services? Could one big image do the job? 

3. Software and languages: I like this section - could the highlight color randomly generate so it's a different color on each hover? It's a minor detail but could be a nice touch...

4. Other experience/personal skills could be combined or removed - these categories feel more like a pdf or printed resume and less like a online portfolio.

5. Selected client portfolios (maybe call it "Work Samples"): I'd move this up (above software and languages) and add thumbnails, gifs or a hint of something visual...
